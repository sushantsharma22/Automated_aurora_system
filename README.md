# ðŸŒŒ Aurora Alert Signup

This project was built to provide timely aurora borealis alerts to people in Windsor and surrounding regions. It allows residents to register for notifications when conditions are favorable for viewing the northern lights.

Users can sign up with their name, email, and city. The system automatically avoids duplicate entries and limits signups to 100 users â€” for now â€” to keep things reliable and manageable. This limit may be expanded in future updates.

It's designed for anyone who doesnâ€™t want to miss rare aurora sightings due to short notice or unreliable sources.
